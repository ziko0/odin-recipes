    <p>Ajarski khachapuri is a boat-shaped Georgian bread with a cheese-stuffed crust and an egg baked into the center. It's only a matter of time before this fun bread is delivered to every home for pizza night and ordered from every brunch menu the morning after. This versatile bread takes a little finesse, but the payoff is well worth it; after all, what more could you want other than cheesy, soft, chewy bread dipped in runny yolk and molten cheese?</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <h2>Dough:</h2>
            <li>½ cup warm milk</li>
            <li>⅓ cup warm water</li>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons white sugar</li>
            <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed, for dusting</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <h2>Cheese Blend:</h2>
            <li>8 ounces feta cheese, crumbled</li>
            <li>4 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded</li>
            <li>4 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
        <h2>Filling:</h2>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter, cut into 4 pats</li>
        <li> sea salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps:</h1>
    <ol>
        <li> Make dough: Combine milk, water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast forms a creamy foam, about 5 minutes. Add 2 cups flour, olive oil, and salt; mix until a sticky dough forms. </li>
        <li> Turn dough out onto a floured surface. Knead for about 3 minutes, adding in remaining 1/4 cup flour as needed, until dough is very soft but still workable. Form into a ball and place in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in volume, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  Turn dough out onto a floured surface. Knead for about 3 minutes, adding in remaining 1/4 cup flour as needed, until dough is very soft but still workable. Form into a ball and place in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in volume, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. </li>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). </li>
        <li> While dough rises, prepare cheese blend: Toss together feta, Monterey Jack, and mozzarella cheese in a medium bowl. Refrigerate cheese mixture until needed. </li>
        <li> Punch down dough and turn out onto a floured surface. Flatten slightly and cut in half. Place 1 dough half on a sheet of parchment paper dusted with flour. Roll out into a rectangle about 1/8- to 1/4-inch thick. </li>
        <li> Arrange 1/4 of the cheese mixture in 2 rows, 1 to 2 inches from the longest sides. Roll sides up tightly over cheese, forming a canoe shape. Pinch and twist ends to seal. Trim excess parchment and lift dough onto a baking sheet. Shape and stuff remaining dough half. Fill canoes with remaining cheese mixture. </li>
        <li> Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Form a well in the center of each khachapuri using a spoon; crack an egg inside each well. </li>
        <li> Return to the oven and bake until eggs are mostly set, 3 to 4 minutes. Place 2 pats butter over each egg, then sprinkle with salt and cayenne. Plate khachapuri; tear off one end and use it to stir butter into egg. </li>
    </ol>
